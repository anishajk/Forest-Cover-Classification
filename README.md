# Forest_Cover
A project towards completion of CS6140 - Machine Learning (Northeastern University)

To run the experiments follow the steps below after cloning the repo. 

1. Unzip the `data` dir and dont change the name.
2. Run `mlp.py` for training the MLP model and saving the results.
3. Run `logistic.py` to train and save the results for the logistic regression model.
4. Run `knn.py` for KNN.
5. Run `random_forest.py` for Random Forest Classifier.

The command to run a file - `python mlp.py`
NOTE: Don't forget to cd into the ml_project dir.

Additional information:
1. `models.py` will have the MLP and LR.
2. `data.py` has the code to fetch and modify the data accordingly.
3. `performance.py` has the code to fetch the performance results and save the plots.
4. `train.py` has the training loop and testing loop.
5. `pplots.py` has the code for result analysis.
